    "(Answer) Despite the density decreasing with depth below 400m, the water column is not unstable. The formula used to calculate density in part (a) does not include the effect of compressibility of water. In the upper levels of the ocean the effect of pressure is small and the formula is valid, but in the deeper layers it is no longer negligible."
